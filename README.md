# ab-initio-Operating-system
Building an operating system from mostly scrach 

So either you curious about creating an operating system or you've become one with the Rountree. Either way happy to have you.
This should be an easy process unless its not because you've angered the computer gods, but thats why im here to help you through it. 
The file step by step should get you going (because thats exactly what I did) an if it's not finished I broke a server. 

      ** Warning **
      If you poor interns have to use root for any reason, ask permission the first time ;)

I am writing this as an intern so patience please
